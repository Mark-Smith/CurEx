CurEx (Currency Exchange project)

Enter a value and a currency, select a destination currency and hit the 'equals' button.

Each time you change the source currency, a timer is reset. Any currency calculation that is requested within ten seconds of the timer reset utilizes cached values for calculation. Otherwise rates are re-fetched.
